=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0) Meditate for five minutes upon the importance of disabling anticheat for
   Elden Ring. Decide if you will do it using Mod Engine 2 (see below) or
   through some other means.

1) Install the static modded game files from either `Game (Full Mod)` or
   `Game (Darkness Only)`, depending on what you want. You have two options:
    
    a) Download Mod Engine 2 for Elden Ring, copy the mod files into Mod 
       Engine's `mod` folder, and run it with `launchmod_eldenring.bat`. 
       This is the easiest way to play and requires no UXM or backups:
       
            https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases
    
    b) Unpack your Elden Ring installation with UXM, make back ups of
       the original files, and copy-paste the mod files directory into 
       your installation `Game` folder, replacing all existing files. 
       You will have to restore the original files yourself to uninstall 
       later, and disable anticheat yourself when playing. 
       
            [You can find UXM on the FromSoft modding Discord server.]

2) Run `SurvivalModeDarkness.exe`. This is a simple companion program that 
   will connect to your Elden Ring game and create the darkness effects. If
   you don't want the darkness effects, you can simply skip this step. If
   you close the program accidentally, you can restart it without needing
   to restart or even quit out of your Elden Ring game. Note that darkness
   effects will ONLY work if you run this executable AND are using one of
   the two modded events from `Game (Full Mod)` or `Game (Darkness Only)`.

3) Run Elden Ring, either through `launchmod_eldenring.bat` if using Mod
   Engine 2 (which disables anticheat) or through Steam if using UXM
   (after disabling anticheat yourself).
