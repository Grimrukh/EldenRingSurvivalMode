Logic notes

Things to calculate around:
    Material value total
    Stat requirements
    Base scaling?? 
        This is questionable you remember infusions exist
        But at the same time, things would be less inconsistent for int/faith/arc builds

---------
Other notes
    ErdtreeWood: Currently used in a few bow recipes, but can probably be replaced and cut
