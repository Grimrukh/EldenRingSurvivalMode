=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

0) Meditate for five minutes upon the importance of disabling anticheat for
   Elden Ring. Decide if you will do it using Mod Engine 2 (see below) or
   through some other means.

1) Install the static modded game files from `Game (SHARED)`. You can skip
   this step if you want darkness only, as these files will not be used.
   
2) Navigate down the subfolders inside `Game (OPTIONS)` by choosing whether you
   want each feature enabled or disabled. The features are:

       Survival -- hunger, thirst, temperature, and Torrent nerf.
       Weapon Tree -- new weapon crafting/upgrading system.
       Diseases -- random diseases with hidden cure recipes.

   Install the files you find after your 'Diseases' choice. If you
   chose DISABLED for all three, you will only get Darkness (assuming
   you also run the Darkness executable).

   Note that if you want any of these options ENABLED but do NOT
   want Darkness, follow the same installation instructions, but skip
   step 2 below (that is, just don't run the Darkness executable).

   You have two methods for installing all of the above files:
    
    a) Download Mod Engine 2 for Elden Ring, copy the mod files into Mod 
       Engine's `mod` folder, and run it with `launchmod_eldenring.bat`. 
       This is the easiest way to play and requires no UXM or backups:
       
            https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases
    
    b) Unpack your Elden Ring installation with UXM, make back ups of
       the original files, and copy-paste the mod files directory into 
       your installation `Game` folder, replacing all existing files. 
       You will have to restore the original files yourself to uninstall 
       later, and disable anticheat yourself when playing. 
       
            [You can find UXM on the FromSoft modding Discord server.]

3) Run `SurvivalModeDarkness.exe`. This is a simple companion program that 
   will connect to your Elden Ring game and create the darkness effects. If
   you don't want the darkness effects, you can simply skip this step. If
   you close the program accidentally, you can restart it without needing
   to restart or even quit out of your Elden Ring game. Note that darkness
   effects will ONLY work if you run this executable AND you have installed
   one of the bottom subfolders in `Game (OPTIONS)` (they all have darkness).

4) Run Elden Ring, either through `launchmod_eldenring.bat` if using Mod
   Engine 2 (which disables anticheat) or through Steam if using UXM
   (after disabling anticheat yourself).

Thank you for playing!

This mod was created as part of my annual tradition of making an off-the-wall

made for a game other than the original Dark Souls.

I used my own software Soulstruct, which currently has limited 
support for Elden Ring EMEVD files when installed with Python.
You can find tutorials for Soulstruct (with Dark Souls) on my
